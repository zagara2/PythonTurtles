### What are Python Turtles?
“Turtle” is a python feature that functions like a drawing board.

From http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/intro-HelloLittleTurtles.html : 

"Turtle graphics are based on a very simple metaphor. Imagine that you have a turtle that understands English. You can tell your turtle to do simple commands such as go forward and turn right. As the turtle moves around, if its tail is down touching the ground, it will draw a line (leave a trail behind) as it moves. If you tell your turtle to lift up its tail it can still move around but will not leave a trail. As you will see, you can make some pretty amazing drawings with this simple capability."
